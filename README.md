This repository contains the code, exercises, and resources I am using to learn Python as a complete beginner. The content here progresses along with what I work through over time in interactive tutorials, coding books, and building small projects.
The goal of this project is to provide myself with a chronological progression of the examples, challenges, and programs I've built as I learn to code in Python. I will update the repository with:
- Code written in Python tutorials
- Exercises completed from Python learning books
- Basic scripts and mini-projects built over time
- Cheat sheets, notebooks, and other useful resources
While others are welcome to view the repository, the content is tailored to my own personal learning journey in Python. The examples cover Python basics such as:
- The Python syntax
- Common libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Building small scripts and applications
- OOP and functional programming techniques
- Resources for further self-study
This repository serves as my own reference compendium for learning and practicing Python. Please note that the progression may be more useful for complete beginners to follow along with their own learning path in Python. Let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on building up my Python skills through project-based learning!
