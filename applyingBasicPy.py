"""This script contains some simple examples
What i learn:
    Learn the basics
    - Python installation: Just install visual studio code, create a py file, download the extension and run everthing on the runner. ThatÂ´s all
    - Running Python scripts: Better running in the visual studio runner or a extension, because REPL is bad for big scripts and all, but u can use repl for testing
    - Using the REPL: Run your py scripts in a more faster way, is rlly good for testing new things
    - Comments: Very important u can use # or 3 "
    - Docstrings: A art of saying what u function does, actually this is very important
